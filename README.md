## Tech/Framework used
---

In this project I made use of HTML & CSS, plus a responsive FE framework: <a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a>
<br>

One of the challenges I faced during this project was retrieving the SVGs from the actual website as it was a time-consuming task, despite that, I was able to meet this project's deadline.
